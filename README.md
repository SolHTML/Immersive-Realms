Immersive Realms aims to have the best visuals to performance ratio as possible while still being immersive

# Performance
this pack includes alot of performance mods while also adding some visual mods to improve how the game feels

# Shaders
for the shader i used Mellow Shaders because i found it very beautiful while offering great performance (180-140 fps on my mac mini m2 pro)

# Resourcepacks
for the resourcepacks i used:
extended lantern
torches reimanged
Better Enderdragon
Expressive moves (requires to install customskinloader and change your skin or switch it to the normal expressive moves without eye animations)
Low shield
Low fire
Shiny trims
Fresh animations
and my custom resourcepack made from different resourcepacks including pixel perfection legacy and BlueNerd and some vanilla tweaks and some i even made myself
