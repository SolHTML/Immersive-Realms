Immersive Realms aims to have the best visuals to performance ratio as possible while still being immersive

# Performance
this pack includes alot of performance mods while also adding some visual mods to improve how the game feels

# Shaders
for the shader i used Mellow Shaders because i found it very beautiful while offering great performance (180-140 fps on my mac mini m2 pro)

# Resourcepacks
my own resourecpack that consists of pixel perfection legacy's grass dirt podzol and leaves and 3d sun and moon by vanilla tweaks and some little building blocks textures from some youtuber's pack named "BlueNerd"
